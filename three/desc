01: incompatible
02: headmesh: basic json skeleton import, no textures/controls. Click rotation + pan on view only
03: Failed; robot arm mover excercise
04: Failed; Water-drinking bird; Used to work, failed prob due to links to external libraries that are no longer compatible
05: working demo of independent multi-piece control
06: Failed to load
07:	.01: Failed to load
	.02: working demo of manually skinned mesh, independent multi-piece control, but share/scale/rotation controls only
08: parameterized tubular skinned mesh
09: 	.01: Simple ball spring test: center blue, springed red, smaller springed free-er green; on a grey background; one direction for movement only
	.02: Fancied, more parameterized version. Green's effect is now gooie-like
	Mod candidate ^^^^
10: self-rotating cube mesh test
11:	._: Same as above ^
	.demo: similar, but import colladad test (works but, i think the test itself failed?)
	.demo_2: First import mesh of controllable the woman bust. Texture import failed
	.demo_3: As above ^ but now with textures imported
12:	near copies of 11 ^ (although 11 seems to work better for some reason)
13: 	copy of 12 with readme, basically
14:	11/12 with textures. Also has a no-device demo mode
15: 	Failed?: Import skeleton test
99:	.01: Incomplete scratch setup for the eventual inclusion of a bone elasticity model demo
	.02: Same as 09.02 apparently?
parametric: klein and torus tests
